# Angular2 RxJS Socket.io chat-application

Features:
- JSON Web Token user authentication.
- Chat functionalities implemented using observable pattern and web socket.

Stack:
- Angular2
- RxJS
- Bootstrap
- Socket.io
- Express


- Still no walkthrough here, but I'll update the README once things get more stabilized.
- Note: User data isn't stored, so once you restart the server, your possible existing logins are invalid and therefore socket won't be able to connect.
